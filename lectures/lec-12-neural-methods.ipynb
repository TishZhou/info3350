    "## Neural networks and deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* We've used NLP tools at many points this semester, but this isn't an NLP class\n",
    "* That said, neural methods have transformed many areas of NLP over the last decade\n",
    "    * And deep learning -- a subset of neural methods -- has been very widely applied in machine learning and AI\n",
    "* Our tasks today: define \"neural network,\" relate neural nets to other learning systems, take a look at how a neural network works, and show how to implement a very simple neural classifier in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a neural network?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A neural network is a computing system comprising artificial neurons\n",
    "* Neurons were originally (1940s) intended to model organic brain behavior\n",
    "    * But now, the name is really just a bit of jargon. No one thinks its important whether or not computational neurons have anything to do with biological neurons.\n",
    "* Individual neurons are mathematical functions that take a vector of input values and produce a single output value.\n",
    "    * We've seen lots of these kinds of functions over the semester, not all of them related to actually existing neural networks\n",
    "    * What matters are the details of the functions and the ways they relate to one another in a network\n",
    "* In a neural network, the neurons are connected to one another in one or more layers, so that the output of one neuron is the input of another (or many others)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic regression **is not a neural network** in the modern sense, but it captures much of the spirit of a basic neural network and a lot of the math is related, so let's revisit it\n",
    "* Fit training data to a linear model: $z = W_0 + W_1 x_1 + W_2 x_2 + ...$\n",
    "    * Values of $x\\ $ are observed properties of an object (counts of individual words, say)\n",
    "    * The $W\\ $ s are weights. We multiply the weight associated with each word (for example) by the number of times that word occurs in a document.\n",
    "        * These types of element-wise multiplications between two vectors are called **dot products**\n",
    "    * Add up the weight * count products and we produce an output value, $z$\n",
    "    * Note that values of $z$ can range from -infinity to +infinity\n",
    "* Transform the linear value into a score between 0 and 1 using the sigmoid function: $$\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$\n",
    "* Sigmoid function looks like this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "<img src=\"./images/sigmoid.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* When we train a logistic regression classifier, we're trying to learn the set of weights that produce the most accurate classifications\n",
    "* We learn the weights by:\n",
    "    * Initializing to random values (or equal values, or some arrangement that reflects our best guess about the correct weights)\n",
    "    * Calculating **cross-entropy loss**, that is, how far away are our predicted outputs from the known-true (gold) values.\n",
    "        * Our goal is to minimize this loss function by adjusting the weights in our model\n",
    "        * See Jurafsky and Martin, ch. 5 (\"Logistic Regression\"), for the math, but the short version is that we take (roughly) the negative log of the sum of the differences between the predicted labels (as probabilities ranging from 0 to 1) and the true labels (which are either 0 or 1)\n",
    "        * Trivia point: logistic regression is a more advanced version of the **perceptron** (which uses a binary loss function rather than a probabilistic one). The perceptron was invented at Cornell (by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958).\n",
    "    * Adjusting our weights using **gradient descent**\n",
    "        * Again, the math isn't important to us, but ... we find the gradient (slope) of the loss function by partial differentiation with respect to each of the weights. In short, we find how the loss function chages in response to small changes in each weight, then move the weight in the direction that minimizes the loss. Repeat until the loss function stops changing (much) and hope we've found the global minimum (that is, the globally best weights).\n",
    "* If you've been around neural networks and machine learning, these terms will sound familiar: loss function, gradient descent. Now you know what they mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From logistic regression to feed-forward networks\n",
    "\n",
    "* The problem with logistic regression (which is a great classifier for many problems!) is that it can only learn linear relationships between inputs and outputs. If our problem is nonlinear, logistic regression might not work well on it.\n",
    "* The simplest way to understand the relationship between logistic regression and a basic neural network is that a neural network is made up of multiple logistic-like functions, each of which can learn a different part of the correct solution (where \"solution\" = function that best fits the training data)\n",
    "* Here's a schematic representation (from Jurafsky and Martin) of a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer (the middle one, with labels $h_i$):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/neural_network.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are three layers here: input, hidden, and output.\n",
    "    * The input layer is the data you feed into the system.\n",
    "    * The hidden layer is where the weights are adjusted to maximize classification accuracy. This is what *learns*.\n",
    "    * The output layer translates numerical values calculated in the hidden layer into class probabilities (that is, into specific classification decisions).\n",
    "* The math in this case is the same as in the logistic case, except that:\n",
    "    * We have matrices of weights across the neurons, rather than a single vector of weights for a single neuron\n",
    "    * We have a vector of outputs from the hidden layer, rather a single, scalar output\n",
    "    * Gradient descent is harder, because there are more paths to differentiate\n",
    "        * This is the most consequential difference in practical terms, because it really slows down training\n",
    "        * The standard approach is **backpropagation**. For details, See Jurafsky and Martin, ch. 7 (\"Neural Networks\"). It's like partial differentiation, but performed piece-wise backward through the all the possible paths from outputs to inputs via the hidden layer(s). \n",
    "        \n",
    "### From shallow to deep\n",
    "\n",
    "* Even a neural network with a single hidden layer (of possibly infinite width; that is, made up of arbitrarily many neurons) can be shown to be able to represent a function of arbitrary complexity\n",
    "    * Note in passing: this is a remarkable result. It means that neural networks are immensely flexible in the relationships between inputs and outputs that they can model.\n",
    "    * But this fact doesn't imply that it's *easy* to learn a correct or high-performing representation of an arbitrary function in a neural network\n",
    "* In practice, it can be (sometimes!) more efficient to build networks that are narrower but *deeper*; that have more layers\n",
    "* Deep learning also largely removes the need for (certain kinds of) feature engineering, since the layers learn maximally effective transformations of the data\n",
    "    * But the right kinds of data still need to be present in the first place!\n",
    "    * If you only give your network word counts, it won't magically engineer paratextual features.\n",
    "* You may have heard of **convolutional** neural networks and **recurrent** neural networks. These are networks in which there is not a strict one-to-one connection between all the neurons in each layer.\n",
    "    * Convolutional networks are (or, were) widely used in image recognition\n",
    "    * Recurrent networks (in which parts of layers are connected both forward and backward) are (again, were) often used in NLP applications\n",
    "* All of this is **slow** and involves a lot of matrix math. Two main factors have driven the deep learning revolution over the last two decades:\n",
    "    * Web-scale data, which provides enough instances to learn fine distinctions in complex decision boundaries\n",
    "        * A method that can model arbitrarily complex functions isn't much good if you don't have enough data to explore the function space\n",
    "    * GPUs (graphics cards), which are essentially super-fast matrix calculators\n",
    "        * These make computing with all that data tractable (more or less)\n",
    "* More recently, we've discovered that we can do without recurrence or convolution, provided we have enough data. This is the insight behind the transformer architecture, BERT, and all that has followed. We'll have more to say about that in future lectures. "

A perfect misanthropist's heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us.  A capital fellow!  He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his waistcoat, as I announced my name.",

'Wuthering' being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.  Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large jutting stones.",

It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls.  One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof.  The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it.  Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge.  The floor was of smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.  In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.",

Such an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner.  But Mr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living.  He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: rather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence, because he has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.  Possibly, some people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort: I know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feeling--to manifestations of mutual kindliness.  He'll love and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again.  No, I'm running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes over-liberally on him.  Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me.  Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.",

I 'never told my love' vocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked a return--the sweetest of all imaginable looks.  And what did I do?  I confess it with shame--shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every glance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.

Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but, imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees. I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the table between us. This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen four-footed fiends, of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens to the common centre.

She was slender, and apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most exquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding; small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging loose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in expression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there.  The canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to aid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted to assist him in counting his gold.",

I began to doubt whether he were a servant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of the superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer: still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of a domestic's assiduity in attending on the lady of the house.  In the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure, from my uncomfortable state.",
