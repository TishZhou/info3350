    "## Feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "We've spoken before about **overfitting**. A model that is overfit has learned features of the training data that are unlikely to generalize to new, unseen data. As a rule of thumb, a model is very likely to be overfit if it uses on the order of as many features as the training data contains examples. The signature of an overfit model is good performance when evaluated against the training data, but poor performance when evaluated against held-out test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also know that models fit to high-dimensional datasets can be difficult to interpret. If we use fewer features (while maintaining good performance), it will generally be easier to explain our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Discuss: How might you go about selecting the best features for a classification task?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical dimension reduction is one approach to addressing high dimensionality and overfitting. Another is **feature selection**. When we select features to retain in our model, we're looking for ones that seem likely to provide useful information about the relationship between our objects and the class labels we seek to assign. Two useful approaches to feature selection are **ANOVA f-statistics** and **mutual information**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at both of these methods to estimate feature importance, then see how to use them in `sklearn` to pare down a feature set. We'll also mention **permutation importance**, a strictly *post hoc* empirical measure of feature importance based on the impact to a specified system of ablating individual features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *F*-statistic and ANOVA analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't say much more about ANOVA analysis; you should have seen it in your stats class. It's conceptually similar to a *t*-test, in that it compares the difference in the means of two groups relative to the variance within each group. A large *F*-statistic means that two samples are significantly different. For feature selection, we want features that are (significantly) differently distributed between the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the *F*-statistic is that it only works well for linear, normally distributed relationships. The advantages are (1) that this assumption is often valid and (2), it's super easy to calculate, so is fast when run on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutual information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutual information** (MI) is abstractly similar to correlation or covariance -- it's a measure of how much two variables change together. But MI doesn't assume a linear relationship between the variables and it's suitable for categorical data, so is often preferred for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the math, in the case of categorical data (like we're using here with word counts and class labels), mutual information is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MI(U,V)=\\sum_{i=1}^{|U|} \\sum_{j=1}^{|V|}\\frac{|U_i\\cap V_j|}{N}\\log\\frac{N|U_i \\cap V_j|}{|U_i||V_j|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\cap$ indicates the **intersection** of two sets. $N$ is the total number of observations in each vector. $i$ and $j$ represent the possible values in each vector. And $|U_i|$ is the count of instances of value $i$ in vector $U$. More generally, MI is defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$MI(X,Y)=\\sum_{x \\in X}\\sum_{y \\in Y}P(x, y)\\log\\frac{P(x, y)}{P(x)P(y)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or, in terms of entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MI(X, Y) = H(X) - H(X| Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "since mutual information is symmetric. Put in plain English, the above says that the mutual information is equal to our baseline uncertainty about the value of $X$ (entropy) minus our uncertainty about $X$ given $Y$ (conditional entropy).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: if we have two vectors, $U = [\\alpha, \\beta]$ and $V = [\\alpha, \\beta]$, we know that our MI score should be high, since $U$ is identical to $V$. For an *n*-class problem, the maximum unnormalized MI is log(*n*). In our example, $N$ = 2 (two observations per vector) and $i$ and $j$ are both drawn from the set $\\{\\alpha,\\beta\\}$. Hence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MI(U,V) = \\frac{1}{2}\\log\\frac{2(1)}{1(1)} + 0 + 0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\log\\frac{2(1)}{1(1)} = 0.693147$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The zeros correspond in this example to misaligned labels, of which there are none, hence $|U_i\\cap V_j| = 0$ for all $i\\neq j$ (again, in this specific example of perfect label alignment, not in all cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or consider the slightly more interesting case where $U = [1,1,2]$ and $V = [1,2,2]$. In this case, we calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MI(U,V) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log\\frac{3(1)}{2(1)} + \\frac{1}{3}\\log\\frac{3(1)}{2(2)} + 0 + \\frac{1}{3}\\log\\frac{3(1)}{1(2)} = 0.174416$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual information is often (but not always) reported on a *normalized* basis, in which the raw MI value is divided by log($N$) (or, technically, by the mean entropy of the two variables, but it amounts to the same thing when there are the same number of classes in each variable), the maximum possible MI value for the case. The normalized MI for the first example is 0.693147/log(2) = 1.0. In the second example, normalized MI = 0.174416/log(3) = 0.15876.\n",
    "\n",

Multinomial NB does not binarize inputs, so accounts for the number of occurrences. But Multinomial NB *does* expect nonnegative integers as input. Gaussian NB works with continuous inputs.\n",
